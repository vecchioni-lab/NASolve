to NASolve are recorded here.

The format follows Keep a Changelog. Until the first tagged release, historical
entries are reconstructed from repository history.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Generalized the OP3-specific policy into an explicit standard-phosphodiester backbone contract. `five_prime_phosphate_sites` is the preferred user-facing name (legacy `allow_op3_sites` remains readable). PostMR now treats a requested 5'-terminal phosphate as the complete P/OP1/OP2/OP3 group, preserving a complete group, completing missing OP3 from existing P/OP1/OP2, or seeding a whole missing group from O5'-C5' with recorded idealized starting geometry. Partial ambiguous groups still fail closed.
- Forward explicit 5'-terminal phosphate sites to NARestraints so its site-scoped terminal-phosphomonoester angle restraints can supplement Phenix's native P-OP3 bond without duplicating ordinary internal phosphodiester geometry. Injected custom restraint builders retain their historical call signatures.
- Added site-scoped `experimental_passthrough` for explicitly declared non-standard backbones. Standard phosphate rules are skipped only at those sites; no custom linkage is inferred. Passthrough requires explicit user authorization, persists in run/campaign provenance, and has a two-step `backbone-review` Coot/confirmation workflow that records the inspected model hash without erasing provenance. Reviewed custom backbone recipes and 3'-phosphate construction remain future work.

- Added explicit `[chemistry] terminal_phosphate_sites` to recipe cards. The
  built-in W/5W6W card is now version 1.1.0 and declares D:1, confirmed by Simon
  as a designed 5-prime phosphate. Standalone W selection and campaign planning
  resolve this same card; custom cards declare their own lists. Dataset
  `allow_op3_sites` replaces recipe sites, including an explicit empty override.
- Freeze recipe phosphate origin/id/version/hashes beside the effective sites in
  AutoMR and campaign records. Report sites in AutoMR and campaign plan/status.
  Existing frozen runs/plans never gain permissions from a later recipe version;
  no geometry/linkage checks are loosened and no coordinates are manufactured.

- OP3/O3P is now strictly user-opt-in, including at termini. The new dataset
  `[automr] allow_op3_sites` list is frozen into AutoMR/campaign intent. Internal
  extras are still removed only with verified linkage; unrequested unlinked,
  missing requested, ambiguous or contradictory phosphates require review.
  Explicit permission retains a valid existing terminal group; it does not
  construct absent atoms or authorize an extra oxygen on an internal phosphate.
- Replaced the bundled raw 1AP CCD graph with the tested parameterized monomer
  library dictionary, preserving numerical values and adapting its group to
  DNA. New PostMR 1AP profiles generate residue-selected OP3 modifications and
  freeze checksummed refinement/view artifacts. ReadySet cannot supersede the
  reviewed 1AP definition or swallow modification files during checkpoint
  creation. Normal dictionaries and coordinate/raw run evidence remain intact.
- Added phosphate/profile gates to AutoRefine, Doctor triage and manual imports;
  retained inherited modifiers after relocation, with missing or changed
  artifacts failing closed. Combined dictionary inputs merge their component
  lists instead of concatenating conflicting data blocks.
- Pinned NARestraints to merged stacking commit `1f20e9f` instead of the older
  `v1.1.1` tag for new installs. No DE, sulfur pair-target, observations, Free-R
  or NARestraints workbook changes. Automated external-tool behavior remains
  subject to a live ReadySet/Phenix check; see `docs/1ap-phosphate-integration.md`.

### Added

- `show` now opens an additional anomalous difference map at 3 sigma when
  Coot finds `ANOM`/`PHANOM` in the selected map MTZ or that checkpoint's
  declared refinement MTZ. This also applies to Refine Doctor inspection and
  compatible manual-checkpoint ancestors, irrespective of whether f'' was
  refined. Existing overlays are reused; ordinary maps and their controls are
  preserved. Startup diagnostics record loaded, reused, absent, or error.
- Refine Doctor now tries a bounded mean-data recovery list including
  coordinate-only and group-B-only siblings. Anomalous trials explicitly fix
  wavelength-calculated scattering or refine f'' alone. `--max-trials` defaults
  to five; it and `--cycles` accept 1-10. Trials stop at the first numerical
  pass, technical failure, or budget. Additive reports preserve scattering
  provenance, skipped-recipe reasons, descriptive ranking and inspection steps.
- Unresolved Doctor inversions now remain `REFINE_DOCTOR_REVIEW` (exit 2), with
  a separate inspection candidate. They no longer endorse the source or choose
  a review branch by its R-factor gap. Unavailable Free-R audits stop trials;
  failed/incompatible outputs cannot win by favorable printed statistics.
- Documented the proposed Refine Doctor triage sequence for noisy mean-data
  refinement, conditional anomalous recipes, and campaign stop/inspection
  rules, distinguishing the implemented standalone options from future work.
- Added foreground sequential `campaign run`, stage boundaries, pause requests
  and explicit fresh-attempt retries for frozen schema-1 plans. Scientific
  stages retain their existing gates; blocked and review datasets stop locally
  while other selected datasets continue. Separate schema-1 execution records
  preserve attempt/run ownership, stage results, process identity and recovery
  diagnostics. Resume verifies completed artifacts, refuses to overwrite
  incomplete work, and preserves checkpoint lineage. Campaign status now shows
  exact runs, next stages and checkpoints; numerical success still requires
  model/map inspection. Execution initially supports macOS/Linux.
- Added schema-1 project presets and a built-in `5w6w` planning policy, with
  strict TOML validation and checksummed local resources. Added `preset check`,
  `campaign plan` and read-only `campaign status`: campaigns freeze dataset
  selection, configuration, input hashes and portable model/preset snapshots,
  retain blocked datasets with diagnostics, report duplicate observations and
  detect changed or missing inputs after relocation. These commands plan input
  and model selection; scientific preflight and execution remain separate
  commands. Existing stage and checkpoint schemas are unchanged.
- Published the DOHU input dataset (configuration, authoritative MTZ, autoPROC/STARANISO
  CIF, and summary) for collaborator reruns. Added `examples/README.md` and an
  eight-file SHA-256 manifest covering DOHU and the existing dated QiC example.
  The uploaded short-name QiC inputs match that existing example byte for byte;
  no duplicate dataset or new run history is added. Input bytes are preserved.
- Added local dictionary construction for modified-residue mutations with one
  unambiguous NARestraints record and a supported DNA/RNA construction parent.
  Included `OHU.cif` supports the D:OHU example. Curated overrides take priority;
  missing dictionaries are not downloaded automatically.
- Added Phenix 2.2.x to the file-scoped Data Manager selector policy, alongside
  2.1.x; 1.20.x retains legacy explicit selectors. Other version families still
  stop before allocating refinement state.
- Added a two-stage PostMR phosphate audit. Verified internal OP3/O3P leaving
  atoms are removed before NARestraints and after ReadySet, authorized terminal
  oxygens remain (see explicit recipe/dataset policy above), raw products are preserved, and measured geometry/removals are
  recorded under `phosphate_cleanup`. Ambiguous or damaged phosphates stop
  preparation instead of receiving guessed coordinate repairs.
- AutoSol reports now record an optional checksummed density-map reference,
  availability status, and diagnostic independently of phase acceptance.

- Added a tracked POSIX `./nasolve` source-checkout launcher. It resolves
  symbolic links, uses the checkout's `.venv` by default, accepts an explicit
  `NASOLVE_PYTHON`, and scopes `src` path injection to the launched process.
- Added portable run, dataset, and repository artifact anchors. Newly created
  checkpoint registries no longer depend on a collaborator's checkout path.
- Added compatibility rebasing for legacy run reports containing absolute
  paths from another computer.
- Added `nasolve workspace use`, `status`, and `clear`. An active dataset/run is
  stored in the existing user configuration, allowing stage commands to omit
  repeated paths.
- Added collaboration and AI-review guidance in `AGENTS.md`,
  `docs/collaboration.md`, and the pull-request template.
- Added a frozen SHA-256 for authoritative reflections to new AutoMR reports.
- Added a checksummed, run-local `Model/seq_base.txt` snapshot for new standard
  frame runs when the selected catalogue supplies it, so conditional AutoSol
  can continue without the source catalogue.
- Added SHA-256 values for AutoSol heavy-atom and refinement-phase outputs.

### Fixed

- ReadySet exit status 0 with the explicit `No unknown residues` result is now accepted as a successful no-op when Phenix writes no `*.updated.pdb`. NASolve preserves the already-prepared model, still runs its phosphate/atom-count audits, and records the no-op output mode; missing ReadySet output without that explicit success condition still fails closed.

- Refine Doctor's interactive `i` answer now opens the recommended checkpoint
  in Coot and returns to the same selection prompt. Answers take effect after
  Enter; only `y` selects a checkpoint. Declining, blank input, EOF or Ctrl-C
  preserves the current selection, and an inspection-launch error allows a
  retry. Printed inspection/selection commands now quote paths with spaces.
- AutoSol now uses fully qualified PHIL parameter paths, including nested
  phasing, model-building and general settings. This fixes Phenix 2.2 rejecting
  the ambiguous `data=` argument before reading inputs. Standalone and campaign
  AutoSol retain the same MR model, anomalous labels, wavelength and no-building
  policy. The external-tool fixture now rejects abbreviated parameter names.
- Campaign worker shutdown now recognizes macOS process groups containing only
  exited, unreaped workers when group probes return `EPERM`. Cleanup still
  requires verified inactivity, reaps its owned child and checks the group
  afterward; live or unidentified groups retain the existing error and retry
  safeguards.
- Curated residues already present in a model retain their dictionaries and
  component-identity records even when no mutation is needed, including
  nonstandard modified-pair preparation.
- PostMR phosphate cleanup now tolerates reused atom serials when full atom
  identities are unambiguous. Atom-associated records are removed by identity
  within their model/TER segment; unrelated atoms sharing a serial survive.
  Affected CONECT records still stop preparation if their endpoint serials
  cannot be resolved uniquely. Phosphate geometry guards are unchanged.

- Corrected view/AutoSol test expectations for canonical paths on macOS, where
  `/var` aliases `/private/var`. The affected tests now use an explicit symlink
  fixture on every host, preserving relocation and checksum assertions while
  checking resolved output paths. Runtime path resolution is unchanged.

- `show` now follows the selected current checkpoint, including manual and
  PostMR nodes. Newer unselected attempts do not replace that view. Manual
  models inherit clearly labelled ancestor maps only with matching observations.
- PostMR and AutoSol views now load the prepared model and ligand dictionaries.
  PostMR prefers accepted AutoSol density when available; AutoSol displays its
  density-modified map and separate heavy-atom overlay. Console and launch
  records identify the model and map sources, with missing/corrupt declared
  sources reported explicitly.

- AutoRefine now omits unsupported Phenix Data Manager Miller-array blocks on
  Phenix 1.20.x while retaining the exact observation, Free-R, and optional HL
  phase file/label selectors on the command line. Phenix 2.1.x keeps the
  file-scoped Data Manager block that prevents ambiguous MTZ-array selection.
- Refine Doctor now passes the same version-derived reflection-selector policy
  to every bounded AutoRefine branch.
- Fresh-terminal source launches no longer depend on macOS Python loading the
  editable-install `.pth` file; this avoids `ModuleNotFoundError: nasolve` when
  that metadata carries the hidden file flag. The launcher also places the
  checkout package ahead of the current directory, so an unrelated
  `nasolve.py` cannot shadow it.
- Bound AutoRefine observation, Free-R, and experimental-phase Miller arrays
  explicitly to their source MTZ files through the Phenix Data Manager. This
  fixes Phenix 2.1 preflight failures when an MTZ contains multiple equally
  suitable observation arrays, such as `IMEAN,SIGIMEAN` and anomalous
  intensities.
- Committed PostMR runs can now resolve their prepared model, authoritative
  observations, restraints, Phaser outputs, and optional AutoSol inputs after
  the repository is cloned or moved.
- Legacy paths now prefer the selected checkout even when the collaborator's
  old checkout still exists, understand Windows/POSIX path forms, and reject
  traversal or ambiguous rebases.
- AutoRefine recovers approved AutoSol phases after relocation when the root
  checkpoint was created before AutoSol completed.
- AutoRefine now fails closed when an approved phase source is unavailable,
  instead of silently continuing without the requested phases.
- Malformed saved workspace, run-report, and checkpoint JSON now produces a
  guarded NASolve error instead of an uncaught type exception.
- Coot views now fail closed when a reported map, primary refinement MTZ, or
  required ligand dictionary is missing or fails checksum validation.
- AutoSol and Coot now verify available frozen model/data checksums before
  consuming relocated artifacts.
- Legacy AutoSol runs recover the exact declared frame's `seq_base.txt` after
  relocation even when the historical pair-model filename no longer exists;
  the selected checkout wins while an older checkout is still present.
- Coot scratch creation rejects unsafe checkpoint path components and existing
  symlinks that could redirect logs, launch records, or backups outside a run.

### Changed

- Every AutoRefine checkpoint and round report now records the discovered
  Phenix version and the selected `legacy-explicit` or
  `data-manager-file-scoped` reflection-selector mode. Refine Doctor reports
  record the same provenance. Unknown, malformed, and unvalidated Phenix
  version families stop before allocating a refinement or Doctor directory.
- AutoRefine reuses the checksum produced by mandatory phase validation when
  writing the child checkpoint, avoiding a second full read of the AutoSol MTZ
  in each round. A stable file-identity check before and after Phenix rejects
  phase replacement, modification, or deletion during the external process.
- AutoRefine checkpoint serialization hashes each unique output file once, so
  legacy Phenix layouts that use one MTZ for maps and refinement reflections
  no longer read that potentially large file twice.
- AutoRefine now writes file-scoped Miller-array selections into
  `autorefine.params` while retaining the existing `xray_data` refinement
  parameters for compatibility.
- Separate AutoSol phase files receive their own file-scoped
  Hendrickson-Lattman label selection.
- `automr` uses the active workspace dataset when its dataset argument is
  omitted. `postmr`, `autosol`, `autorefine`, `refine-doctor`,
  `checkpoints list`, `checkpoints add`, `checkpoints use CHECKPOINT`, and
  `show` can use the active run.
- Checkpoint schema 2 uses `anchor` plus `relative_path` (or an explicit
  `absolute_path` fallback), SHA-256, and size. Refinement review outputs such
  as maps, reflection/mmCIF files, metrics, and logs use the same references.
- A newly allocated AutoMR run becomes active automatically. Explicit one-off
  paths passed to later stages do not silently change the active workspace.
- Machine-local Coot GUI scratch and PostMR Coot backup directories are ignored;
  portable stage artifacts remain visible for deliberate commits.

### Tests

- Doctor triage regression coverage includes the QiC inversion ranking case,
  ordinary IMEAN fallbacks, fixed and f''-only scattering, alternate selections,
  missing prerequisites, unavailable audits, failed external runs, budgets,
  immutable sibling lineage and inspection without selection. The complete
  local suite passes 393 tests and 129 subtests, with two existing platform
  skips. New Phenix recipes still require live validation on the user runtime.
- The assembled fixes pass 225 tests. The full local run with
  `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 PYTHONPATH=src` also passed 51 subtests; the user
  confirmed 225 passing tests on the Apple Silicon checkout.
- On 2026-09-09, DOHU `AutoMR/run_004` completed AutoMR, PostMR, and a full
  five-cycle AutoRefine execution with Phenix 2.2.1-6174 and Coot 1.3.3:
  TFZ 14.30, final Rwork/Rfree 0.147/0.209, and current checkpoint `refine-001`.
  The user confirmed successful Coot inspection. The
  [validation record](docs/validation-dohu.md) preserves the raw clashscore,
  lattice context, execution details, and limits of this check.
- Added coverage for current/manual checkpoint views, AutoSol map provenance,
  relocated and symlinked paths, and phosphate cleanup with duplicate serials
  and atom-associated records.
- Added Phenix 1.20.1-4487 compatibility regressions that emulate rejection of
  the Data Manager block and verify exact anomalous/mean observations, Free-R
  flags, separate HL phases, automatic target selection, Doctor propagation,
  and report/checkpoint provenance without production use of `--unused_ok`.
- Added fail-before-mutation coverage for unknown or unvalidated Phenix
  versions and retained the Phenix 2.1 file-to-array binding regressions.
- Revalidated the post-patch `data-manager-file-scoped` path from a relocated
  temporary Q:iC run with Phenix 2.1-6048. Dry-run preflight and a one-cycle
  refinement both exited successfully; the intentionally short refinement was
  retained as `AUTOREFINE_REVIEW` at Rwork/Rfree 0.177/0.160.
- Added source-launcher coverage for fresh terminals, symlink resolution,
  argument and working-directory preservation, `PYTHONPATH` scoping, explicit
  and default interpreters, current-directory import shadowing, and
  missing, directory-valued, and non-executable interpreter diagnostics.
- Added hash-call regression coverage for inherited/recovered AutoSol phases
  and shared AutoRefine MTZ outputs, plus phase drift during Phenix, immutable
  failed-attempt retention, and successful next-round recovery.
- Added relocation coverage for reports created beneath a collaborator's
  absolute directory.
- Added coverage for anchored run/dataset references and path-escape rejection.
- Added repository-anchor and exact frame-sequence relocation coverage,
  including old and current checkouts existing at the same time.
- Added same-machine-copy, cross-platform legacy-path, schema migration, and
  checksummed-reflection coverage.
- Added legacy AutoSol coverage for reports that predate frozen input hashes.
- Added workspace configuration and optional-target parser coverage.
- Added regression coverage for mean-intensity refinement without AutoSol.
- Expanded coverage for anomalous observations, Free-R flags, and a separate
  experimental-phase MTZ.
- Validated the AutoRefine selector patch with Phenix 2.1-6048 in both a
  `--dry_run` preflight and a complete five-cycle E:G refinement that reached
  `AUTOREFINE_READY`.
- Re-ran all four example workflows end to end with Phenix 2.1-6048 and Coot
  1.3.1. Fresh five-cycle refinements reached `AUTOREFINE_READY` for E:G
  (TFZ 11.80, Rwork/Rfree 0.127/0.168), the F:D synthetic integration fixture
  (TFZ 11.80, 0.131/0.171), Q:E (TFZ 10.80, 0.161/0.208), and Q:iC (TFZ
  10.80, 0.146/0.148). Q:iC retained the expected non-blocking AutoSol warning
  and refined its anomalous iodine without experimental phases.

### Migration

- New phosphate checks apply to newly prepared PostMR outputs; existing models
  and immutable runs are not rewritten. Use a new run to reproduce preparation
  with these checks. The new AutoSol map reference is optional for older reports.
- No configuration or artifact migration is required for the source launcher;
  the generated package entry point remains supported when its editable
  installation metadata loads normally.
- Existing absolute-path reports remain readable; they do not need to be
  rewritten before use.
- Existing checkpoint schema-1 registries are read in place and migrate to
  schema 2 on their next write. Older NASolve versions reject schema 2 instead
  of interpreting an anchor-relative path against the current directory.
- Portably resolvable legacy references are normalized during migration;
  unavailable or external-only legacy evidence is retained explicitly as
  non-operational provenance rather than remaining a raw schema-1 path in a
  schema-2 registry.
- Legacy AutoMR reports without `reflections_sha256` remain usable and are
  marked `legacy-unverified` when a root checkpoint is first initialized,
  rather than silently claiming observation checksum verification.
- Existing failed refinement rounds remain immutable. Running
  `nasolve autorefine RUN` again creates the next numbered checkpoint.
- Workspace state is machine-local and is not intended for Git.

### Known compatibility notes

- Phenix 1.20.x uses explicit file/label command selectors without the newer
  Data Manager block; Phenix 2.1.x and 2.2.x use both. User validation also
  completed Q:iC refinement and bounded Refine Doctor branches on 1.20.1-4487
  with `legacy-explicit` recorded in the refinement report.
- File-scoped Data Manager parameters remain validated with Phenix 2.1-6048
  in preflight and complete refinement runs.
- The new live Phenix 2.2.1-6174 check covers mean-intensity refinement with
  no experimental phases and anomalous refinement off. It does not constitute
  a new live AutoSol or anomalous-refinement validation for that version.
- Large MTZ/map histories may eventually warrant Git LFS; current fixtures are
  intentionally kept in ordinary Git until a repository-wide LFS policy is
  adopted.
