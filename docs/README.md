# NASolve documentation map

NASolve documentation is organized by role, not chronology.

## Start here

- [`../README.md`](../README.md) — human-facing overview, installation,
  normal commands, and why the major safeguards exist.
- [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — durable implementation contracts,
  artifact/checkpoint invariants, and stage responsibilities.
- [`gui.md`](gui.md) — planned modular NASolve GUI shell, scientific hierarchy,
  checkpoint/model tree, semantic colors, CLI capability coverage and
  capability-driven extensibility contract.
- [`development-handoff.md`](development-handoff.md) — current validated state,
  immediate next work, active scientific caveats, and known blockers.
- [`collaboration.md`](collaboration.md) — workspace, portability, Git, and
  artifact-handling rules.

## Active subsystem contracts

- [`sequence-family-targets.md`](sequence-family-targets.md) — explicit
  sequence-reference target assembly, standalone AutoMR/PostMR integration, and
  campaign sequence-thread inheritance.
- [`backbone-chemistry.md`](backbone-chemistry.md) — phosphodiester,
  terminal-phosphate, and unsupported-backbone policy.
- [`campaigns.md`](campaigns.md) — campaign orchestration contract.
- [`campaign-planning.md`](campaign-planning.md) and
  [`campaign-execution.md`](campaign-execution.md) — current campaign stages.
- [`model-compatibility-facts.md`](model-compatibility-facts.md) — descriptive
  search-model, checkpoint-candidate, and donor-to-recipient compatibility
  provenance; no donor eligibility or automatic reuse.
- [`construct-registration.md`](construct-registration.md) — logical
  construct-to-coordinate registration design, the merged core/Scout v1
  boundary, the current Oak experimental Scout v2 proposal layer, and the
  forward-looking Registration Net / opt-in Topo Net topology-informed
  automation design, including tile hypotheses, polymorphic junctions built
  from minimal backbone-passage primitives, representation seams,
  repeat-bearing/root strands, long-period repeat-phase closure, a persistent
  surgery/refine workbench and bounded Topo Surgeon repair/fallback semantics;
  [`construct-registration-intent.json`](construct-registration-intent.json)
  records machine-readable inference policy, validation checkpoints, and real-W
  attempt history, while
  [`construct-registration-live-checks.md`](construct-registration-live-checks.md)
  keeps the minimum human/real-workflow validation queue, including the completed
  renamed-real-W Scout v2 shadow validation and the remaining live-wiring gates.
- [`campaign-model-roadmap.md`](campaign-model-roadmap.md) — forward-looking
  model/sequence/processing architecture and the current Campaign Doctor
  implementation boundary.

Machine-readable schemas and small recipe examples beside these files are part
of the active contract.

## History

[`history/`](history/) contains superseded validation diaries, integration
notes, and old handoff snapshots.

These files are retained because they can explain regressions, failed approaches,
and why later contracts exist. They are evidence, not instructions.

When history and active documentation disagree, use the active documentation,
current tests, and current code as authoritative. Git history remains the
fine-grained chronology.
